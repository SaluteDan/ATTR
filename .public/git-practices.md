If you're planning to use Git for version control for your web3 project, there are a few best practices for structuring your project that can help make it easier to work with and maintain.

Keep the smart contract and front-end code separate: Your smart contract code should be kept separate from your front-end code in different folders. This will make it easier to track changes and collaborate with other developers.

Use a project root folder: Keep all of your project files in a single root folder that includes subfolders for the smart contract code, front-end code, documentation, and other files. This makes it easy to navigate your project and find the files you need.

Use appropriate naming conventions: Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for your files and folders. For example, you can use the pattern "contracts/", "src/", "build/" or "dist/" for smart contract, source, build and distribution files respectively.

Keep track of third-party libraries and dependencies: Use a package manager like NPM or yarn to manage your project's dependencies and make sure that the correct versions of all libraries and dependencies are included in your project.

Use Git branching strategy: Use a Git branching strategy like Git Flow or GitHub Flow to manage your code branches. This will help you keep track of different versions of your code, merge changes, and collaborate with other developers.

Add a README file: Add a README file to your project root folder, including information about the project, installation instructions, and any other information that will be useful for other developers who work on the project.

Include relevant files in .gitignore: Files like build files, test files, and local environment files should be added to a .gitignore file so they're not tracked by git, but keep in mind that important files like smart contract bytecode and ABI should be kept in the repository.

Use Git best practices: It's also a good idea to use Git best practices like committing frequently, writing clear and descriptive commit messages, and using pull requests to review and merge changes.

By following these best practices, you'll be able to structure your project in a way that makes it easy to work with, collaborate with others and maintain the entire lifecycle of your project using Git.
